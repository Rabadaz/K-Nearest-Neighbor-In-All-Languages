# K-Nearest-Neighbor C Implementation

This Project Implements the KNN Algorithm in C

## The KNN Algorithm
  Simple Lazy-Learing Algorithm to get going with Machine Learning
### How does it work
  1. Claculate all the Euclidean Distances to the Trained Points
  2. Sort them by the Distance Asccending
  3. Filter out the smallest N Values

### Euclidean Distance
  Is used to Calulate the Distance between 2 Points in a Multidimensional Room:
 
    âˆš((p1_1 - p2_1)^2 + (p1_2 - p2_2)^2 + ... + (p1_x - p2_x)^2))


## Why do We do this?
  In every Language the "Hello, World!" Example is the first Thing you do, but just printing Hello world does not really show how the Language works, so we use the commonly known KNN for demonstration of all the Languages and their Features
